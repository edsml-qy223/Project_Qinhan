Data science actual combat series and projects based on heart failure prediction algorithm


· Report(Qinhan Yu+Jie Lu).pdf
 The data of 299 patients with heart failure were studied, and each patient had 13 clinical features. The data set is analyzed, and three different machine learning models are used to create survival prediction models for patients. Multivariate variables are analyzed, and the model is adjusted by decision tree classifier, and the correct rate reaches 82%. Using logistic regression adjustment model, the correct rate reached 83%; Using neural network to adjust the model, the correct rate reaches 96%.

 This paper studies the commercial value of target goods and finds high-value customers, analyzes the order data of an e-commerce platform, evaluates the value of goods by Kmeans clustering, establishes Logistic regression model and decision tree model based on Gini coefficient combined with RFM index, and puts forward a set of processes and methods for screening high-value customers. The classification accuracy of Logistic regression model is 80.83%, AUC value is 0.916, and the best threshold is 0.098. The classification accuracy of decision tree model based on Gini coefficient is 87.61%, AUC value is 0.917, and the best threshold is 0.209. The comprehensive performance of the decision tree model is slightly better than that of the Logistic regression model, but the fitting effect of the two models is better, so it can be used to screen high-value customers.


· week1_Logarithmic linear model.pdf
 Using R language and regression model, this paper explores the factors that affect WeChat official account's reading. Descriptive analysis of 20 variables in 1000 WeChat official account, establishment of log-linear regression model, variable selection and multicollinearity test by stepwise regression method are carried out, and key factors affecting reading quantity are obtained. 

· week2_Logistic.pdf
 Through logistic regression model, customer churn early warning analysis is carried out. Derived variables such as individual degree and individual information entropy are introduced for analysis. Logistic regression model is established and ROC curve, capture rate curve and confusion matrix are drawn. The data analysis report is written in R language for more than 10 pages. 


· week5_Survival analysis.pdf
 Select data and indicators for modeling and forecasting. We try to analyze data, establish logistic regression model and model prediction to explore the problem of AIDS drug prediction, and put forward business suggestions. The logistic regression model can be obtained with good effect.


· week6_Gender difference.pdf
 Based on the measurement of gender differences in R language, this paper explores the distribution of global and sub-index scores, the relationship between index scores and income, religious beliefs and the changes of scores in various countries under GGGR index system, and obtains the progress of eliminating gender differences in the world and in various countries. Following the thinking from the whole picture to the details, from the core to the influencing factors, and from the cross-section to the changing trend, I gradually mastered the influencing factors and changing trends of gender differences, and wrote more than 10 pages of data analysis reports. 


· week7_Epidemic forecast analysis.pdf
 Based on the epidemic data released by the National Health and Health Commission, this paper attempts to predict the growth rate of newly confirmed cases in the next day. Based on the growth rate index, we established a linear regression model. Finally, we took the growth rate of newly confirmed cases, the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases and the growth rate of cumulative deaths as the main factors to establish the model, and got a good result, with R square around 0.8045.


· week8_RFM.pdf
 Establish RFM model, use Kmeans for cluster analysis, and draw the cloud map of operation quantity barrage words, weekly operation quantity distribution map, daily operation quantity distribution, etc. Classify the features of 400,000 pieces of customer data, propose solutions for different types of customers, and implement them through R language and write reports. 

· week10_pakage.pdf
 Using PageRank algorithm and the data of 18-20 years of changing majors in Nankai University, the popularity of majors is ranked, and a professional yearning matrix is established by establishing a pointing link on the college's benchmark webpage, and the scores are calculated by PageRank algorithm to rank majors, and an analysis report is written. Using naive Bayesian model to learn 50,000 commodity names and categories; 

· week11_text processing.pdf
 The unstructured text data, such as commodity names, are segmented according to a self-defined dictionary, and high-frequency word cloud images are drawn; Establish document-word frequency matrix, transform features into binary matrix, and establish classifier to realize text classification, with the correct rate of 93.9%.
